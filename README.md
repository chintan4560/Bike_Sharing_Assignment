# Bike_Sharing
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. The US bike-sharing provider wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. 
> In this project, we will discover which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and building linear regression model for prediction of count of shared bikes.

## General Information
- We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the bike-sharing company to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
