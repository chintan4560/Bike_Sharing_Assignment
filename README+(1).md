# Bike_Sharing
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. The US bike-sharing provider wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. 
> In this project, we will discover which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and building linear regression model for prediction of count of shared bikes.
